##How do I register my kill on my phone?

Congrats, you killed someone!  Your victim should go to the game page that you are both playing on their phone and tap "I've been Killed".  A code will appear on their phone.  Ask them politely for it, then on your game screen tap the Assassins icon in the middle of the screen and enter the code in the input box.  If successful, a message will appear that says "nice kill".
